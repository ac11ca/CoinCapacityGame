CoinCapacityGame
================
A research project with Adrian Camilleri and Rick Larrick.

CCG is a web app we're calling the Coin Capacity Game which tests decisions about capacity investments.  It is an experimental paradigm we would be happy to share with any other researchers interested in using it.  The site is written in PHP with jQuery UI elements and a MySQL db for storing game settings as well as participant decisions and outcomes.

Research is in progress, but [see sample results from the fist completed study here](http://swift.pw/data/ccg_results.html).
